### Hello! My name is Petros Karampelas, and I am an economics graduate completing his military service. My professional interests surround quantitative trading and machine learning. I also enjoy studying literature concerning the inner workings of the financial system. I am currently using GitHub solely for my masters applications, however I am looking forward to enriching my profile with more additions as I continue to practice coding.

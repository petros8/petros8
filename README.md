### Hello! My name is Petros Karampelas, and I am an economics graduate completing his military service. My professional interests surround quantitative trading and machine learning. I also enjoy studying literature concerning the inner workings of the financial system. I am currently using GitHub solely for my masters applications, however I am looking forward to enriching my profile with additional projects as I continue to practice coding. At this time, I put attention to projects where learning algorithms are coded from scratch without the use of specialized libraries, as this is a good way of understanding the underlying reasoning and math.

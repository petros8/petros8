### Hello! My name is Petros Karampelas, and I am currently a Mathematical and Computational Finance student at Oxford. My professional interests surround quantitative trading and machine learning. I also enjoy studying literature about shadow banking and financial plumbing. Throughtout winter term, I will be using GitHub to showcase my coding projects, since it is the best way to practice coding. Any feedback on my projects is very much appreciated!

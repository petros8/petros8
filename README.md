### Hello! My name is Petros Karampelas. I have recently finished my degree in Eocnomics, and I am currently studying Mathematical Finance at Oxford. I am professionally interested in developing trading strategies through scientific methods. In my free time, I enjoy studying literature on monetary mechanics and financial plumbing, and self studying math subjects which I find interesting . I use GitHub to showcase my pet projects. Any feedback is greatly appreciated!
